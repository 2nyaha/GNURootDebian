In an effort to make GNURoot Debian more compatible with all
Linux applications, we have moved your home directory from
external to internal storage. External storage spaces often
don't allow executables, and because of the way Android handles
file permissions GNURoot can't perform a lot of it's nifty
behind-the-scenes work in external storage either.

That being said, you can reach the old home directory if you
need to for any by navigating to

/sdcard/GNURoot/home

Thanks for your patience as we continue to perfect our app!
